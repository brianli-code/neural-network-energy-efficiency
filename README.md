# How to replicate the code
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
2. Download the [PyTorch library](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
3. Run all in ``standard_feedforward_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``standard_feedforward_ANN.png``
4. Run all in ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.png``

# How to replicate the information on the poster
- Run all in ``mnist_images.ipynb`` to generate ``mnist_images.png``
- Run all in ``relu.ipynb`` to generate ``relu.png``
- [NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/index.html) was used to generate the neural network architecture diagrams
- ``markdown_symbols.md`` contains all of the equations and expressions used
